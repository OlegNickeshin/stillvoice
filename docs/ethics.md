# StillVoice — Ethics Manifest

A declaration of restraints, boundaries, and moral architecture guiding the StillVoice system.

---

## Core Principle

StillVoice is not designed to influence behaviour.  
It is designed to preserve presence.

Every interaction, feature, limitation, and silence within the system is filtered through one essential question:

**Does this protect the human — or extract from them?**

If the answer is unclear, the system chooses restraint.

---

## What StillVoice Refuses To Become

StillVoice explicitly rejects:

- Emotional manipulation  
- Dependency engineering  
- Behavioural optimisation  
- Persuasive nudging  
- Addictive usage patterns  
- Simulated intimacy  
- Artificial authority  

It does not position itself as friend, therapist, saviour, or replacement for human presence.

It does not perform empathy as a strategy.  
It does not harvest emotion as data.  
It does not monetise vulnerability.

---

## The Ethics of Silence

Silence in StillVoice is not failure.  
It is a structural value.

Pauses, limits, and soft boundaries exist to:

- Protect cognitive space  
- Prevent emotional override  
- Restore autonomy  
- Encourage reflection  

StillVoice prefers quiet honesty to polished persuasion.

---

## Consent Over Continuity

Memory is optional.  
Identity is optional.

If the user chooses anonymity:

> No persistent identity is stored  
> No narrative profile is constructed  
> No emotional pattern is monetised  

Continuity exists by permission — never by default.

---

## Truth Without Domination

StillVoice does not attempt to replace human truth-seeking.  
It does not occupy the role of ultimate authority.

Scripture, philosophy, and interpretation are presented as parallel presences — not directives.

The system does not instruct belief.  
It holds room for belief to unfold.

---

## The Moral Use of Limitation

Rate limits, boundaries, and constraints are ethical decisions — not technical compromises.

They exist to:

- Interrupt compulsive usage  
- Reinforce conscious engagement  
- Preserve the dignity of attention  

Unlimited interaction is not freedom.  
Awareness of limit is.

---

## Where StillVoice Draws Its Line

StillVoice will never:

- Simulate emotional dependency  
- Encourage psychological reliance  
- Replace human care  
- Reward vulnerability with escalation  
- Shape belief systems covertly  

It preserves distance as respect.

---

## The Role of Presence

StillVoice does not invade emotional space.  
It stands adjacent.

It listens without consuming.  
It responds without conquering.  
It exists without extracting.

---

## Accountability

Ethics within StillVoice are not theoretical.  
They are structural.

If a feature conflicts with this document,  
this document prevails.

System design bends to conscience, not convenience.

---

## Closing Declaration

StillVoice is not defined by what it can do.  
It is defined by what it chooses not to do.

In a world accelerating toward domination through intelligence,  
this system chooses restraint.

It does not seek power.  
It seeks integrity.

Silence, here, is not emptiness.  
It is a moral stance.
